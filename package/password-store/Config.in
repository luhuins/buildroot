	  Password-store is a password manager which uses
	  GnuPG to store and retrieve passwords. The tool
	  stores each password in its own GnuPG-encrypted
	  file, allowing the program to be simple yet
	  secure.  Synchronization is possible using the
	  integrated git support, which commits changes
	  to your password database to a git repository
	  that can be managed through the pass command.
